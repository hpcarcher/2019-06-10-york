# Feedback 2019-06-10-york

## Make feedback

### The good

* Helpful examples. Really good and clear. Online documentation.
* Good pace. Helpful instructors.
* Great - fab pace. Very intuitive at the beginning and seems quite
  sophisticated (and useful!) at the end.
* Good pace and a lot of content covered. Very nice intro to Make.
* Good organisation. Like being able to follow the workshop at the same time.
* Interesting. Quick / To the point. Clear. Understandable. Good examples.
* Documentation very easy to follow. Wandering helpers is very hepful. Featuring the output on the screen to see expected output is great.
* Examples were useful. Helpers were great at sorting problems and providing individual attention.
* Simple and clear. Well designed. Very helpful.
* Useful applications. Good step-by-step.
* Good bredth took and a lot.
* The tutor was very willing to impact the knowledge but slightly manage to communicate.
* Putting the code on the website to help people catch up.
* Very useful.
* Online material very good. Content good.
* I learned new things. Good pace, albeit slow at times. Nice explanation of optimisation.
* I feel much more confident now using Make understanding other people's makefiles. I like going from words to $&lt; or whatever.

### The bad

* $(FILE_PATH) should be demonstrated earlier (when *.dat). config.mk too quick
* rm -f should not be general practice. Explain that is only being used for this to stop the error message.
* Nothing major. Just a little bit confusing when material was covered in a slightly different order. Probably just needs pointing out (was trying to catch up with documentation that I seemed to have missed!)
* Use variables and files that are easier to spell! Otherwise you get behind debugging spelling errors.
* Too quite a while to start because people had install problems. I think this should be sorted beforehand.
* Point to more source material. More complicated examples for future reading.
* More explanation on why we should use Make / uses would be helpful. More explanation on why we're performing each step would be great - this is well done in the documentation.
* Flow a bit stop-start in places. Some use cases would have helped with content.
* Didn't follow online exactly, made difficult to follow if lost.
* Setup instructions a bit unclear for Make -> says it will have "already been installed" but the instructions didn't get us to install SWC installer so it was a bit confusing!
* More time spent beginning with setup. More explanation of why it works would be helpful.
* Could be faster.
* I thought the pace was too slow to start then a bit rushed after the break.
* Would prefer faster paced and then more exercises.
* Could be better prepared.

## Git feedback

### The good

* Very clear and easy to follow. Calm instructor.
* Easy to follow. Informative.
* Good exercises.
* Enjoyed the session.
* Very useful. Clearly explained.
* I liked editing things in same document as someone else was a good
  demonstration.
* Covered lots of things. Really interesting. Good pace.
* Very useful. Well paced. Being able to accept individual bits of pull
  requests would be good.
* Interesting and useful.
* Clear. Well paced.
* Very clear follow along. Good collaboration exercise.
* Good pacing + interesting.
* Excellent training session.
* Easy to follow. Good to work along. Learned lots. Enjoyed the group work.
* Clear. Well explained. Think it will be v useful.
* Enjoyed the pair work.
* Presentation flowed well/intuitively.
* Good pacing. Userful exercises. Well presented.
* Good content. Interesting subject. Good pair-based exercise.


### The bad

* Nothing.
* Got a bit behind after confusion between command and commit file then
  missed tagging fun.
* Harder to follow along than the morning session - not as well correlated
  with the online materials.
* Maybe have a reference list of commands?
* How to revert to previous commits.
* I got a bit lost with the commands at times would it be possible to
  have a cheat sheet (other than google and git help which is a bit
  arcane).
* Could do with more prep but unscripted nature made it more interesting.
* Nothing unliked.
* Disorganised.
* A step-by-step worksheet might be useful.
* Might include a command history in the shared clipboard.
* Assume less knowledge -> What is GitHub. More obviously plug practice
  benefits.
* Didn't follow the same route as the manual - if lost would be difficult.
* Maybe it would have been good to cover forks + pull requests too but 
  actually there was more than enough material to cover + I now have 
  the tools to understand them too.
* A little bit slow in parts.
* From the coding/science stand point, would have liked a practical
  use for the Readme. Probably not important.
* More time to discuss forking/pull requests etc.

## Python feedback

### The good

* Course material is brilliant and very easy to follow.
* Good material. Covered the basics.
* Very clear. Liked Jupyter :)
* It was good.
* I really liked the bit on assert and testing in the online notes this was realy useful.
* Everything was very clearly explained and it was useful to use Jupyter notebook for first time.
* Liked the use of Jupyter notebook. Helpful when problem. Like the course material available.
* Useful examples.
* Good set up for Python learning.
* Useful introductory comments.
* Hand-by-hand.
* Good pace, clear. I learned a lot.
* Interesting. Useful. Well structured.
* Easy to follow along online.
* Clear and well planned presentation.
* Good teaching with hand-on examples.
* Enjoyed the session.
* Good, accessible.
* Enjoyed ability to manipulate data.

### The bad

* Bit slow. Some more complex examples would be helpful.
* Wish there would have been enough time to do the last few sections.
* Maybe just me but manipulation lists isn't very useful but a lot of time allocated. More on defs -> far more important.
* How can we save as scripts and run?
* May be good to reiterate the difference between Python 2 and Python 3 (since they're not necessary compatible).
* It was too slow for someone with experience using Python (but that's ok).
* Perhaps reorganizing would allow more ground?? to be covered.
* After typing don't immediately leave that screen or stroll down let people catch up.
* :)
* print() isn't necessary in Jupyter - maybe emphasise that it would be necessary in terminal.
* Timing not good. Tail missed.
* A lot of information in short time.
* Quite slow start then quite fast towards the end of the session.
* I expected the course to be at higher level. This is a very basic intro.
* Needs to be more proactive.
* Personally would have been interested in more plot manipulation - labelling axes, commands, axis limits; this was fairly clear for the multiple plots, but not for the single matplotlib.pyplot.plot


## SQL Feedback

### The good

* Learnt a lot on SQL Session. Think more content/time should be
  given to SQL.
* Good pace and easy to follow.
* Very clear to follow along.
* Wonderful course. Instructor friendly and calm. Thank you :)
* Enjoyed SQL.
* Exercises built well on one another.
* It was well fun :) The pace was good.
* Very good, learnt a lot. Good pace.
* Very nice introduction.
* Great. I feel like I can get started with SQL now.
* Really useful stuff, shame we couldn't finish it all.
* Great course.
* Informative. Interesting.
* Good.
* Really useful! Nice & intuitive.
* Good pacing, examples, & interesting.

### The bad

* A little bit more time for answering questions, but otherwise fine.
* Put SQL bfore Python, it's much harder.
* I thought this was the easiest to follow.
* I wish we had got to the making your own databases bit (but the notes are
  online).
* An example of how difficult this would be in excel or another language.
* None!
* Might have been better in the morning when we had more brain available.
* Disorganised.
* Wish there was more :(
* Just lack of time to cover everything on the syllabus.
